This is a task app that I built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack.

While planning this project my goal was to get familiar with how fullstack applications are structured and how to make them work.

When I first started the project I didn't know how to setup the folder structure, so I started looking through Github MERN project repos just to see how other people did it.

Once I had a rough idea how the project was setup I copied that and took a section of time to get introduced with MongoDB.

I went through MongoDB's Node.js developer path certification, which went through the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases,
how MongoDB works, setting up a database on MongoDB Atlas, light data modeling, how to query, and a tiny bit of writing data pipelines.

The frontend is built with React using Typescript.

Overview:<br> 
    - Basic Todo app.<br> 
    - Featuring adding, removing and listing tasks.<br> 

Built using:<br> 
    - MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Axios and Typescript.<br> 
      - React, Axios, Typescript for the frontend.<br> 
      - Node, MongoDB, Express and Typescript for the backend. <br> 

Operation:<br> 
    1. Terminal pointed towards backend root folder.<br> 
       - Run `npm run start`.<br> 
    2. New terminal pointed towards my-app root folder.<br> 
       - Run `npm run start`<br> 
    3. localhost:3000 should open automatically.<br> 

Project_notes:<br> 
    - I keep a running log while building the project.<br> 
    - Typically I start out with an idea.<br> 
    - Tasks that need to be completed are outlined.<br> 
      - When a task is completed, I move it into a seperate completed tasks section.<br> 
    - Bugs are recorded and put into it's own section.<br> 
      - Fixed bugs are moved into the completed tasks section with a small write up of the solution.<br>
